Planning Phase

Personal goal

Beyond the goals set by the task, I aim for simple & agnostic code that can used by anyone to deploy the environment in a quick & easy manner.

Toolbox

Deciding on Infrastructure

Initially, I desired to remain local & deploy the environment on VirtualBox using a provider & provide a Vagrant 'toolbox' VM but due to using musl standard library instead of glibc I faced technical issues.
I setteled on Azure instead since an Active Directory service is required & Azure is a Microsoft product so superb integration is expected.

Deciding on IaC

In the current scenario, the choice of Terraform & Pulumi is a personal preference, I chose Pulumi. 
Terraform is mature, as such documentation is plenty, & it uses a DSL so it's great for 'Ops' background folk. 
Pulumi is more dynamic due to its programming library nature & caters to 'Devs'.

Roadmap

The end is goal is to provide access to static content served by a webserver & a Splunk dashboard via HTTPS with a certificate generated by Active Directory.
The access & integration between the webserver & Splunk dashboard will be developed first since it's the focal point of the task. The Active Directory certificate is only secondary to functioning service.

Development Phase

Beginning with setting up the Linux VM over at Azure. Pulumi provides handy templates with boilerplate code to make this process quicker & a web-app AI code generator.
SSH keys for accessing the VMs will be generated locally & uploaded to Azure to be consumed by the rest of the infrastructure.
The Ansbile code is structured so it will be able to provide future scaling easily.
